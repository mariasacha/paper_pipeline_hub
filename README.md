This is the code to implement the multiscale computational framework presented in "A computational approach to evaluate how molecular mechanisms impact large-scale brain activity" by M. Sacha, F. Tesler, R. Cofre and A. Destexhe

The entire pipeline of the framework can be run through the file "whole_pipeline.ipynb". The file contains the simulations in the multiple scales (from single cell to whole-brain level). The analyses of Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI),  functional and structural connectivity and the dynamical analysis of the spiking network and mean-field which are presented in the paper are also included. 

In the notebook Tf_calc/tf_fit.ipynb an example of the Transfer Function fitting process is provided.

Requirements: All the project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install these dependencies, use pip install -r requirements.txt . This project used Python 3.11.5
